# data-ts

Common algebraic structures heavily inspired by Haskell typeclasses adapted for fluent [pointfree](https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree) interfaces in Typescript. Strictly typed.

## Install

```sh
yarn add data-ts
```

## Import

```typescript
import { Maybe } from 'data-ts';
/* or */
import * as Maybe from 'data-ts/lib/Maybe';
```

## Run Test

```sh
$ yarn jest
$ yarn jest --watch
```

## Publish

```sh
$ yarn publish
```

## Instances

- [ ] Identity
- [X] Maybe
- [ ] Either
- [ ] Task
- [ ] List
- [ ] Map
- [ ] Set
- [ ] Trie


## TODO Ideas

- implements the lazy version of Either, Identity types that apply multiple maps per item
- implements naive, non-persistent (but immutable) versions of: LinkedList, Stack, Tree, Dictionary (still useful for small inputs)
- implements **persistent** versions of: LinkedList, Stack, Tree, Dictionary

Note: this project does not implemented to be in compliant with [Fantasyland](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) but I draw a lot of inspiration from it. I however opt to be in consistent with Haskell interfaces but adapt it to be ergonomic in Typescript/Javascript.


## Brain dump

- semigroup/monoid is useful because it allows you to implement pairwise funtions/operators and they will just work on your monoid (e.g. list). With associativity and that allows divide & conquer algorithms, parallelization, and incremental accumulation.
- function composition can be a monoid if the functions have the same type of input and output (endomorphism)
- hence, a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors

> A **functor** is a structure-preserving transformation between categories. It's some way to map objects from one category to objects of another category while also preserving the arrows between objectsâ€”think of it as a category homomorphism. ... An **endofunctor** is a functor from one category back to the same category.

`fmap` (haskell) can be viewed as `fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)` which shows the preserved structor that maps from `(a -> b)` into `(f a -> f b)`
